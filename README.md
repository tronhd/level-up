to practice and what not
General Testing Notes
Question protocol:
every question you ask
who within your organization uses the answers to each question
what they use them for
whether an answer is required or optional
if an answer is required, what happens if a user enters any old thing just to get through the form
Hint text should be used where users are more likely to make a mistake, like when having to satisfy a complex set of password rules. Error messages should be a last resort.
Accessibilty notes
Make fields easy to tap—44px height or more is good.
Be tolerant of mistakes like extra whitespace, dashes and slashes. Do the hard work so users don’t have to
